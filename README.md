Week 4 assignment.

Create an interactive TODO list application.

I created a mini form that lets the user:
input the name of the task
add it to a list of tasks
check a box to mark the task as done
delete a task by way of clicking a button

Additionally the form will block empty an empty entry and prompt the user to type a value, by way of an alert box.
