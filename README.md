Week 4 assignment.

Create an interactive TODO list application.

I created a mini form that lets the user:<br/>
*input the name of the task<br/>
*add it to a list of tasks<br/>
*check a box to mark the task as done<br/>
*delete a task by way of clicking a button<br/>

Additionally the form will:<br/>
*block an empty entry<br/>
*prompt the user to type a value, by way of an alert box.<br/>
